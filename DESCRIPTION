Version: 0.1.0
Author: Kelsey Chetnik
Maintainer: Kelsey Chetnik <kchetnik73@gmail.com>
Description: Utilizes 12 peak quality metrics and 9 diverse machine learning algorithms to build a classifier for the automatic
  assessment of peak integration quality of peaks from untargeted metabolomics analyses.
  The 12 peak quality metrics were adapted from those defined in the following references:
