#' Calculate Sharpness (of a Chromatographic Peak)
#'
#' Calculate Sharpness of the integrated region of a chromatographic peak. The Sharpness is found by determining the sum of the
#' difference between the intensities of each adjacent pair of points on the peak normalized by the intensity of the peak boundaries.

#'
#' @param peakData A vector containing characteristic information about a chromatographic peak - including the retention time range
#' @param pts A 2D matrix containing the retention time and intensity values of a chromatographic peak
#' @return The Sharpness value (double)
